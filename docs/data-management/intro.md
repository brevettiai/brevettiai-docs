# Introduction

The Platform lets users create, manage, or participate in datasets, which work as spaces for hosting any kind of dataâ€”such as images, documents, sound files, tables, and more. At its core, a dataset in the Platform is a designated space \(hosted by [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)\) that described by a name, a purpose, and a range of tags while being controlled by the role-based access control system built into the Platform.
