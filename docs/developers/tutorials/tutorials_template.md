# Introduction

## Build your own

We have made a small application sample you can use as base when developing model and report types to the platform, including an example CI pipeline for bitbucket.

[Telescope application bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.org/criterionai/telescope/src/master/)

## Try it out
Tutorials are available to form the basis of the brevettiai python sdk documentation, and each tutorial is a stand-alone jupyter notebook that can illustrate part of the API.

The notebook are linked directly to Google Colab instances that can be used to run the notebooks.
