# Model training
Once your model has been set up and your virtual environment is correctly set up, you may start a model training using a command prompt.

To start a model training, you first need to provide the prompt with an API key and job ID for the model you wish to use. These can be extracted from the Brevetti AI platform.

### Job ID
To extract the job ID, navigate to your model in the platform. The Job ID is found in your browser address field, being the code listed after the last '/'.
(F.ex. "https://platform.brevetti.ai/models/**806fd8f4-6675-45d0-a143-5807a7a50741**")

### API key
The API key is also extracted from your model page. Select "Options --> Show API Key" in the right side of the screen, and a pop-up with the API key will be shown (if you have access rights to it).
