# Introduction
The model-training-and-testing section describes how to set up a model, train it and finally test it using the Brevetti AI platform.
This tutorial will be based on the use of Brevetti AI's internal repository, image-segmentation, aswell as the open-source library Criterion-core and tensorflow-onnx.

To run a model training locally, the following open-source repositories must first be cloned locally, preferably to a virtual environment, and subsequently pip installed. Remember to use the branch "development" if you want to test locally.

* https://bitbucket.org/criterionai/core/src/development/
* https://github.com/brevettiai/tensorflow-onnx
If using the image-segmentation repository
* https://bitbucket.org/criterionai/image-segmentation/src/development/

When the repositories are cloned to your virtual environment, they should follow a folder structure like this:
- python/criterionai/image_segmentation
- python/criterionai/core
- python/criterionai/tensorflow-onnx
- ...
