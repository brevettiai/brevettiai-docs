# Introduction
The python web api implementation found in the brevettai package gives a lightweight programmatical interface to all the functionality that the [Brevetti AI platform](https://platform.brevetti.ai) offers.

This enables high level access for
* automation of tasks on the platform
* tagging of datasets or models
* dataset management
* managing models etc...

This document shows how this api can be used to get access to datasets and create a model training job.

Web access is granted with your website user, allowing you to automate tasks on the platform. In Python this is achieved through the **BrevettiAI** object.

To explore the code by examples, please run the in the notebook that can be found on colab on this link [Brevettiai Web Api Documentation](https://githubtocolab.com/criterion-ai/brevettiai-docs/blob/master/src/developers/python-sdk-brevettiai/brevettiai_web_api_documentation.ipynb)
